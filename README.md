# Overview

As someone who hopes to have a future in the tech industry, data is an important part of any project as well as the ability to explain said data. That's why I decided to take the time to find out more about data analysis. With this knowledge, I hope to gain a stronger skillset in the data world.

The data set that I working with is a dataset containing some of the top grossing movies from each year from 1989 to 2014. It provides the movie's name, MPAA rating, budget, gross, release date, genre, runtime, and rating. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/movie-gross-and-ratings-from-1989-to-2014?resource=download)

While the purpose of the software is primarily to grow out my data analysis skill set, this was a passion project for me. I was genuinely curious how different catagories affected the data. This entire project was a joy and extreemly fascinating for me.

# Data Analysis Results

* Which Genre Generates the Most Gross? - Action is the highest grosser, with over 30 billion dollars, followed closely by animation and comedy. The lowest grossing genre is history and western.
* What is the Distribution of MPAA Ratings for each Genre? - Comedy is the genre with the highest number of movies, followed by action. Animation has the highest number of G and PG movies. Action has the highest number of PG-13 movies. Drama has the highest number of R rated movies.
* Which Genre has the Highest Rated Movies? - Over the past 40 years, history, fantasy, and western are the highest rated genres. While this is good, in theory, these genres have the lowest number of movies produced within those 40 years. Drama shows the highest potential, as it has the 4th highest number of movies made while ranked 5th in average movie rating.
* What is the Relationship Between Budget and Gross? - There isn't a strong relationship between budget and gross, but movies between $125,000,000 and $250,000,000 do the best.
* What is the Distribution of Gross Between each MPAA Rating? - PG-13 movies make significantly more money than any other rating, with more than half of the total gross of all movies coming PG-13 movies. PG movies are a close second, taking up about a quarter of all gross, with G and R taking up the remaining percentage.

# Development Environment

To create this project, I used R to code a RMD file that visualizes the data. I used R Studio to develop this RMD file. In this file, I used the ggplot, mosaic, and tidyverse library.

# Future Work

In the future, I would like to implement the following:
* Find a more diverse dataset that includes data outside of the top grossing films
* Create a visualization that demonstrates the relationship between budget and profit
* Make my graphs more visually appealing
